And he said, “They're known to do things like that, | 44. Better move out of there.” | 45. My mother said, “I just moved in, how am I gonna move out?” | 46. He says, “I dunno.” | 47. He says, “But they don't want any black people in there.” | 50. So uh, she said, “Well you're the law. | 51. You're supposed to protect us.” | 52. He says, “I can't do anything with it.” | 53. He was Irish himself. | 54. “I can't do anything about it.” | 55. So my mother said um, “Where is the uh precinct you work from?” | 56. And he told her. | 57. I forgot now. | 58. I was right there with her | 59. but I've forgotten where he told her. | 60. So uh she said, “Well if you can't do anything to help me, I'll go see who – if I can't find someone else to help me.” | 61. Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms and white people, you know, they uh many times didn't assert themselves. | 62. But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind. | 63. And she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school. | 64. She went to Lackawanna high school. | 66. And we went – she took me, and we went to the police station. | 67. And they also had police wagons with horses attached to them. Believe it or not in those days. | 68. So my mother said, to the captain, “What are you going to do about it?” | 69. And he says, “Well lady there's nothing we can do about it.” | 70. And she says, “You mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?” | 71. She says – he says, “Well uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.” | 72. He says, “Because” – he said to me, “Did you see anyone?” | 73. And I said, “No.” | 74. He says, “Well how can – how can you” – to my mother – “how can you do anything if you don't know who – who to put the blame on?” | 75. An' he says, “I'm sure there was more than one person.” | 76. So my mother said, “Well I don't know what I'm going to do.” | 77. She says, “But one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.” | 78. They took all we had to, to pay the rent. | 79. In that house you had to pay in advance. | 80. And she said, “If they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me. | 81. Now the real estate agent should be accountable.” | 82. So anyhow, she said to him, “Well I know one thing you can do.” | 83. And he says, “What's that?” | 84. She says, “You can take me home.” | 85. He said, “Take you home?” | 86. She said, “Yes in the police patrol.” | 87. So – I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.” | 88. And they had never come up with anybody like that. | 89. So they put us in the police patrol | 90. and they took us home. | 91. We weren't far from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved. | 92. And – course with the horses and the police patrol, and the clang – | 93. they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang – | 94. you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.” | 95. Well this police patrol that bell they had, it went “Clang clang clang.” | 96. And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening. | 97. And of course they saw the man came around the back – | 98. I can see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around, | 99. and opened the door in the back. | 100. And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol. | 101. Well we got out of that police patrol – | 102. Before the patrol ever left my mother turned | 103. and faced all those people that were standing around, | 104. and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.” | 105. She says, “I know that I am different from you, color wise, | 106. but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are, | 107. and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.” | 108. She told them that they had rented the house, | 109. she told them how much money she had paid, | 110. she had told them that was all the money she had. | 111. And they had paid that rent for a month. | 112. She knew she was going to be there for the month. | 113. She did not know beyond the month. | 114. Whether they'd have enough money to pay it for the next month. | 115. But she knew they were going to be there for the month. | 116. She said, “It is winter time and it is cold. | 117. And I cannot afford to be buying windows.” | 118. “Now” she said, “Whoever threw the stones I don't know. | 119. But you can all see what has happened. | 120. And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month. | 121. So you might just as well make up your mind to that. | 122. If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.” | 123. Well of course you know they didn't do that. | 124. They probably didn't have any money either. | 125. So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick. | 126. And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been. | 127. When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else. | 128. But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood. | 129. And it was terrible | 130. and it certainly was frightening for me."

I was ten years old at the time this happened – | 33. And I finally found my mother. | 35. And while I was trying to tell her what had happened | 58. I was right there with her | 61. Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms and white people, you know, they uh many times didn't assert themselves. | 62. But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind. | 63. And she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school. | 65. And this was – let me see what year was this happening – well it must have been nineteen twenty-five, so you can see what – what the times were. | 66. And we went – she took me, and we went to the police station. | 68. So my mother said, to the captain, “What are you going to do about it?” | 69. And he says, “Well lady there's nothing we can do about it.” | 70. And she says, “You mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?” | 71. She says – he says, “Well uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.” | 72. He says, “Because” – he said to me, “Did you see anyone?” | 73. And I said, “No.” | 74. He says, “Well how can – how can you” – to my mother – “how can you do anything if you don't know who – who to put the blame on?” | 75. An' he says, “I'm sure there was more than one person.” | 76. So my mother said, “Well I don't know what I'm going to do.” | 77. She says, “But one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.” | 78. They took all we had to, to pay the rent. | 79. In that house you had to pay in advance. | 80. And she said, “If they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me. | 81. Now the real estate agent should be accountable.” | 82. So anyhow, she said to him, “Well I know one thing you can do.” | 83. And he says, “What's that?” | 84. She says, “You can take me home.” | 85. He said, “Take you home?” | 86. She said, “Yes in the police patrol.” | 87. So – I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.” | 88. And they had never come up with anybody like that. | 89. So they put us in the police patrol | 90. and they took us home. | 91. We weren't far from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved. | 92. And – course with the horses and the police patrol, and the clang – | 93. they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang – | 94. you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.” | 95. Well this police patrol that bell they had, it went “Clang clang clang.” | 96. And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening. | 97. And of course they saw the man came around the back – | 98. I can see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around, | 99. and opened the door in the back. | 100. And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol. | 101. Well we got out of that police patrol – | 102. Before the patrol ever left my mother turned | 103. and faced all those people that were standing around, | 104. and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.” | 105. She says, “I know that I am different from you, color wise, | 106. but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are, | 107. and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.” | 108. She told them that they had rented the house, | 109. she told them how much money she had paid, | 110. she had told them that was all the money she had. | 111. And they had paid that rent for a month. | 112. She knew she was going to be there for the month. | 113. She did not know beyond the month. | 114. Whether they'd have enough money to pay it for the next month. | 115. But she knew they were going to be there for the month. | 116. She said, “It is winter time and it is cold. | 117.

If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.” | 123. Well of course you know they didn't do that. | 124. They probably didn't have any money either. | 125. So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick. | 126. And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been. | 127. When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else. | 128. But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood. | 129.

Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms and white people, you know, they uh many times didn't assert themselves. | 62. But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind. | 63. And she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school. | 64. She went to Lackawanna high school. | 65. And this was – let me see what year was this happening – well it must have been nineteen twenty-five, so you can see what – what the times were. | 66. And we went – she took me, and we went to the police station. | 67. And they also had police wagons with horses attached to them. Believe it or not in those days. | 68.

He said, “Take you home?” | 86. She said, “Yes in the police patrol.” | 87. So – I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.” | 88. And they had never come up with anybody like that. | 89. So they put us in the police patrol | 90. and they took us home. | 91. We weren't far from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved. | 92. And – course with the horses and the police patrol, and the clang – | 93. they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang – | 94. you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.” | 95. Well this police patrol that bell they had, it went “Clang clang clang.” | 96. And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening. | 97. And of course they saw the man came around the back – | 98. I can see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around, | 99. and opened the door in the back. | 100. And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol. | 101. Well we got out of that police patrol – | 102. Before the patrol ever left my mother turned | 103. and faced all those people that were standing around, | 104. and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.” | 105.

They probably didn't have any money either. | 125. So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick. | 126.

Before the patrol ever left my mother turned | 103. and faced all those people that were standing around, | 104. and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.” | 105. She says, “I know that I am different from you, color wise, | 106. but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are, | 107. and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.” | 108. She told them that they had rented the house, | 109. she told them how much money she had paid, | 110. she had told them that was all the money she had. | 111. And they had paid that rent for a month. | 112. She knew she was going to be there for the month. | 113. She did not know beyond the month. | 114. Whether they'd have enough money to pay it for the next month. | 115. But she knew they were going to be there for the month. | 116. She said, “It is winter time and it is cold. | 117. And I cannot afford to be buying windows.” | 118. “Now” she said, “Whoever threw the stones I don't know. | 119. But you can all see what has happened. | 120. And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month. | 121. So you might just as well make up your mind to that. | 122. If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.” | 123. Well of course you know they didn't do that. | 124. They probably didn't have any money either. | 125. So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick. | 126. And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been. | 127. When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else. | 128. But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood. | 129.

So my mother said, to the captain, “What are you going to do about it?” | 69. And he says, “Well lady there's nothing we can do about it.” | 70. And she says, “You mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?” | 71. She says – he says, “Well uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.” | 72. He says, “Because” – he said to me, “Did you see anyone?” | 73. And I said, “No.” | 74. He says, “Well how can – how can you” – to my mother – “how can you do anything if you don't know who – who to put the blame on?” | 75. An' he says, “I'm sure there was more than one person.” | 76. So my mother said, “Well I don't know what I'm going to do.” | 77. She says, “But one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.” | 78. They took all we had to, to pay the rent. | 79. In that house you had to pay in advance. | 80. And she said, “If they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me. | 81. Now the real estate agent should be accountable.” | 82. So anyhow, she said to him, “Well I know one thing you can do.” | 83. And he says, “What's that?” | 84. She says, “You can take me home.” | 85. He said, “Take you home?” | 86. She said, “Yes in the police patrol.” | 87. So – I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.” | 88. And they had never come up with anybody like that. | 89. So they put us in the police patrol | 90. and they took us home. | 91. We weren't far from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved. | 92. And – course with the horses and the police patrol, and the clang – | 93. they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang – | 94. you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.” | 95. Well this police patrol that bell they had, it went “Clang clang clang.” | 96. And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening. | 97. And of course they saw the man came around the back – | 98. I can see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around, | 99. and opened the door in the back. | 100. And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol. | 101. Well we got out of that police patrol – | 102. Before the patrol ever left my mother turned | 103. and faced all those people that were standing around, | 104. and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.” | 105. She says, “I know that I am different from you, color wise, | 106. but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are, | 107. and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.” | 108. She told them that they had rented the house, | 109. she told them how much money she had paid, | 110. she had told them that was all the money she had. | 111. And they had paid that rent for a month. | 112. She knew she was going to be there for the month. | 113. She did not know beyond the month. | 114. Whether they'd have enough money to pay it for the next month. | 115. But she knew they were going to be there for the month. | 116. She said, “It is winter time and it is cold. | 117. And I cannot afford to be buying windows.” | 118. “Now” she said, “Whoever threw the stones I don't know. | 119. But you can all see what has happened. | 120. And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month. | 121. So you might just as well make up your mind to that. | 122. If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.” | 123. Well of course you know they didn't do that. | 124. They probably didn't have any money either. | 125. So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick. | 126. And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been. | 127. When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else. | 128. But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood. | 129. And it was terrible | 130. and it certainly was frightening for me."
