    "narrative": "We moved down to Third and uh Wharton. We had gotten moved but it was like – you remember I told you my father drank but it was still day and after he had gotten in and put the furniture where it was supposed to go my mother left to go to market to get some food to bring into the house. And my father went to take the horses – take the team of horses back. But he didn't come home. He – uh – I stopped somewhere on – I dunno but he – that's where – how he – why he wasn't in the house. And of course I was left there with the kids. Well no sooner did my mother get out of the house – my father went first – then – oh it was such an awful crash came through the window. And I – and I looked and it was a big stone. And then of course they – they – well they stoned the house. And I had sense enough to get the kids into the stairway so that they wouldn't get hurt by flyin' gla- glass. And I said to them “Now you stay there. Don't move 'cause nothing will reach you here. And I'm gonna go and see if I can find mom” – (We call our mother mom.) And they were crying and carryin' on. I was scared to death I really was frightened out of my wits. And I didn't know what to do but I remember saying a prayer as I went out the front door because I didn't know what was gonna hit me when I went out that door. And I ran – I was ten years old at the time this happened – I ran to Fourth street because I knew my mother wa- They had push carts in those days on Fourth street. And it was a Jewish neighborhood and they – they stayed open until – until all hours. Because they would you know however much money they could get they wanted. So uh that's where she was going to do her shopping. And I finally found my mother. I did find her. And while I was trying to tell her what had happened a policeman went by. And my voice was such that you could hardly make out what I was saying. I was so nervous and – and – my voice was shaking so and he wanted to find out what ha- what was wrong with me. And then when he understood what the situation was he turned to my mother and says “This is a bad neighborhood. It's Irish.” And he said “Th- they're known to do things like that Better move out of there.” My mother said “I just moved in how am I gonna move out?” He says “I dunno.” He says “But they don't want any black people in there.” An' he didn't say black 'cause they didn't use black then. But “they don't want anybody in there.” So uh she said “Well you're the law. You're supposed to protect us.” He says “I can't do anything with it.” He was Irish himself. “I can't do anything about it.” So my mother said um “Where is the uh precinct you work from?” And he told her. I forgot now. I was right there with her but I've forgotten where he told her. So uh she said “Well if you can't do anything to help me I'll go see who – if I can't find someone else to help me.” Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms an' – an' – an' white people you know they uh many times didn't assert themselves. But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind. And uh she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school. She went to Lackawanna uh high school. And uh this was – let me see what year was this happening – well it must have been nineteen twenty-five so you can see what – what the times were. And we went – she took me and we went to the police station. And they also had police wagons with horses attached to them. Believe it or not in those days. [break in the recording] So my mother said to the captain “What are you going to do about it?” And he says “Well lady there's nothing we can do about it.” And she says “You mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?” She says – he says “Well uh uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.” He says “Because” – uh he said to me “Did you see anyone?” And I said “No.” He says “Well how can – how can you” – to my mother – “how can you do anything if you don't know who – who to put the blame on?” An' he says “I'm sure there was more than uh than one person.” So my mother said “Well I don't know what I'm going to do.” She says “But one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.” They took all we had to to pay the rent. In that house you had to pay uh in advance. And she said “If they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me. Now the real estate agent should be accountable.” So anyhow she said to him “Well I know one thing you can do.” And he says “What's that?” She says “You can take me home.” He said “Take you home?” She said “Yes in the police patrol.” So – I-I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.” And they had never come up with anybody like that. So they put us in the police patrol and they took us home. We weren't far from from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved. And uh – course with the horses and the police patrol and the clang – they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang – you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.” Well this police patrol that bell they had it went “Clang clang clang.” And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening. And of course they saw the man came around the back – I can r- see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around and opened the door in the back. And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol. Well we got out of that police patrol – Before the patrol ever left my mother turned and faced all those people that were standing around and she says “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.” She says “I know that I am different from you color wise but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.” She told them that they had rented the house she told them how much money she had paid she had told them that was all the money she had. And they had paid that rent for a month. She knew she was going to be there for the month. She did not know beyond the month. Whether they'd have enough mother – money to pay it for the next month. But she knew they were going to be there for for the month. She said “It is winter time and it is cold. And I cannot afford to be buying windows.” “Now” she said “Whoever threw the stones I don't know. But you can all see what has happened. And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month. So you might just as well make up your mind to that. If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else. because I do not have it.” Well of course you know they didn't do that. They probably didn't have any money either. So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during during the period of time that we were there my father became sick. And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been. When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else. But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood. And it was terrible and it certainly was frightening for me.",

As the father was drunk, the narrator ran to find the Mum who they thought would know how to resolve the situation given her schooling at Lackanawny. The 'Mom' sought and found a policeman on the street. He said he would like to help but there was nothing he could do even though, or in spite of, he was Irish too. So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it; the police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925. They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard. Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon's arrival to see what the fuss was about. The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children's head and if the locals didn't want them there because they were black then they'd have to provide the money for them to move on. Naturally, this didn't happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament however after this episode they became much friendlier, helping out wherever possible in times of need such as when the drunken father became ill.",

The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black, he didn't say black because they didn't say that then but that's basically what he meant, the officer was Irish as well.

We entered and demanded to speak to the captain, we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer. I was surprised and impressed by my mom, she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five. She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else, and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame, he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone. My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town. My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed. We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it and made a  \"Clang clang clang\" sound as we moved, during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on. When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching, she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month and that we were going to stay for the month and that after that she didn't know, she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people and that they should get used to us being here. She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else, which they didn't because they probably didn't have any money either.

They didn't like black people although the policeman didn't say black but its what he meant , he also was Irish . The police said there's not much we can do about it and asked did I see who did it , I said no that I hadn't seen . he said the only thing to do was move. My mother said we only just moved in and we had no money as we had paid a months rent in advance . we couldn't move . it was Winter and very cold .

I was left alone with my siblings when a stone came crashing through the window. I quickly moved the kids to the stairway for safety and went out to find my mother. I was terrified but I prayed and ran to Fourth street where my mother was shopping. I found her and tried to explain what happened when a policeman approached us. He told us that the neighborhood was bad and suggested we move. My mother refused, stating that we had just moved in and had no money to move again. She confronted the policeman about his duty to protect us but he claimed he couldn't do anything. My mother decided to go to the police station to seek help. She spoke to the captain who also suggested we move. My mother insisted that we couldn't move and demanded that the police take us home. We were taken home in a police patrol and my mother addressed the neighbors, explaining our situation and stating that we would be staying for at least a month.

The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children's head and if the locals didn't want them there because they were black then they'd have to provide the money for them to move on.\n11.

Once he found out, he told my mother that the neighbourhood is Irish, and that we should move out because we're black.\n15. He didn't say 'black' but he said \"They don't want somebody living there\".\n16. My mother said to him that she had spent all of her savings on that months rent, and didn't have enough to move.\n17. She said \"You're civil service, you must protect us\".\n18. He said that he couldn't do that - he was Irish too.\n19. My mother asked \"Where is the precinct you work\".\n20. He told her, but I don't remember the exact details, even though I was standing with my mother.\n21.
