But she had – a young grandson and back then I was quite the tomboy. And apparently, he was trying to befriend me. I never caught on. Truth is I didn't take to him much because he had – He was a charming lad until you saw his manners. He had poor manners. Goodness gracious he had poor manners. Then he left a note one day saying he was going to run away because she was always nagging about me. She came to my treehouse. Big old tabby cat in tow. I talked her down and said “Well we'll go find him and if we can't locate him, you can – go ahead and call the police if you need to.” I was strategizing. So she took my advice. And we went to where they found his baseball cap – near the old mill and we trailed a bit more and we didn't find a trace. And returned – it was a treehouse club – he was sitting on a branch with a comic book in his hand. He hadn't run away. But – however – that resolved it for that day. But that evening the local sheriff, Officer Dawson said “You better lay low and stay out of sight because that woman never forgets anything once she gets it into her mind.” And I did. I laid low and stayed out of sight. That was the second time.",

One day he said he was going to run away from home because I turned him down, and his grandma came to my treehouse with a tabby cat in tow and said I had better go find him. I searched for hours but couldn't find a trace of him other than his baseball cap, so I told Mrs. Baker she had better call the police. As we were on our way back home there he was, in the treehouse with a comic book. He hadn't ran away from home at all. It seemed like everything was fine in the end, but then the local sheriff Officer Blake  came over and told me that I had better lay low and stay out of sight because that woman never forgot a thing when she set her mind on something. So that's what I did, I laid low and stayed out of sight. That was the second time.",
        "5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37": "Discussing growing up, had a neighbour called Mrs Baker who was a cat lady. She had about 20 cats she owned or took in at one point or another. She wanted me to befriend her grandson, though I didn't want to be his friend as he had terrible manners. At the time I was a tomboy. one day her grandson left a note that he was going  to run away as Mrs baker always nagged him about me and he had enough. She came by the treehouse I liked to hang out in and asked for help to find him, I agreed to help and if he could not be found by the end of the day we would alert the police. We went to the mill where he liked to hang out and found his baseball cap, from there the trail went cold. We then found him at the treehouse club with a comic, he hadn't actually run off. The sheriff told me to lay low for the rest of the summer when I got home as Mrs Baker would never forget this or forgive me",
