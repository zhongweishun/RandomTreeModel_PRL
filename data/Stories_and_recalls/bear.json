    "narrative": "This is a story about three of my friends that I met in 1949 when I started college. Actually I met them before that, we became friends after we all... went to school at the same place. Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools, and so we were acquainted. But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school, we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school, and we became quite good friends. I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city. So being big macho men that we all were, they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt, and they'd come out, and help me do chores and things like that. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature. I never really enjoyed hunting. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors, wasn't all that exciting to me. But these guys got a big kick out of it, so I'd go along just to be one of the group. Things went on, we did this for several years, they were always coming out to the farm, and hunting. After we'd been acquainted for several years, one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada. Now that didn't really appeal to me, but I'd always been one of the group, and I couldn't find any real reason not to go, so I left them talk me into it, wasn't too hepped up on this at all. I don't care anything really much about hunting period, let alone bear hunting. Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me. But as I said, I left them talk me into it. So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne, and we flew way up into Canada some place, and we landed on a lake, and then we rented canoes, and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me, 'till we got way up in the north woods. Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes, then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought, 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods. And after I got there, I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started, 'cause I didn't really need any part of that. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you. So we got up there, and got set up in the cabin, and ... got our groceries stored and everything. And after we got to discussing it those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was. We sat around there for three or four days, played cards, and ate, and slept, and we just couldn't ... no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear 'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place. We never ventured outside at night, we stayed right there in the old cabin. Well after we'd been there for three or four days, we got to talking it over, and somebody said “Hey, if we don't go out and hunt some bear ... we've got to find a bear to take back home with us, or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people, 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting, and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.” Soo ... no one wanted to go out, so we all decided that we'd cut the cards. Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear, and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down, so we could take him home with us. So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card, the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place. But I had agreed to play the game ... So ... I took the old gun, and I go out bear hunting. I didn't like this at all. I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like, and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything, and finally I heard a noise, and I turned around, and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life, I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big. I whipped up the gun, and pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey. Well he had ... he just had no desires to have me in his territory, and he made for me. Well there was nothing for me to do but run, and I turned around, I ran as hard as I could go, and I thought I used to be pretty fast, but that old bear, man he was gaining, he was just right on my heels ... And when I got within sight of that cabin I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR!” Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go, and that old bear right on my tail, and they opened the door, and I got right to the cabin door, I made a quick turn to the left, and that old bear went right on in. I just reached back, and pulled the door shut, and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS, YOU SKIN HIM, I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!” Now all this happened thirty years ago, and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment. But can you BELIEVE, they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.",

They had previously been acquainted as high school athletes, but once they entered school together, they all became friends. The man was a farm boy and his friends were all from the city, so they came to his family's farm to hunt and help out with chores. One day, they decided to go hunt a bear, and the man joined them even though he didn't really want to.\n\nThey took a plane up to Canada, and then took their canoes on a big lake, travelled that way for a few days, and then backpacked another 500 miles or so until they reached the cabin they had rented. The area around the cabin was a spooky wood, so they were afraid to go out into the woods.\n\nEventually, they decided that, since everyone was expecting them to bring home a bear, that they had to actually go out and hunt. They drew cards to determine who was going to go out and get the bear (the rest would skin and pack it), and it was the narrator who was chosen. He went out with his gun and found a massive bear, but when he went to shoot it, he found he had forgotten to load his gun. The bear chased him back to the cabin, and his friends opened the door for him just in time.\n\nIt has been 30 years since then, and his friends haven't invited him to go hunting again.",

We were all on the same athletics team.The other 3 lived in the city however I was brought up on a farm and they liked to come up to the farm to help with chores and hunt. As we grew up we were talking one day and someone mentioned about going bear hunting however I really didn’t want to go. I also didn’t want to disappoint the group so I agreed to go even through I didn’t want to. So we took a flight to the canal where we then had to use canoes to get to the bottom of the mountain which seemed to take forever. Once we got to the mountain we then had to walk what felt like 5 days to get to the cabin. Once we got to the cabin we realised how scary the place was so we decided to stay inside and not go out so we stayed in the cabin playing cards. Towards the end of the break we realised if we didn’t take a bear home with us we would be talked about unkindly so we decided that we would cut cards and whoever got the highest would be the one to go get a bear and the remaining 3 would be the ones to skin the bear ready to take home. Unluckily it was me who got the highest card so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear. I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!) I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded. So I ran and ran back towards the cabin. When the cabin was in sight I shouted “open the door” when the door opened I moved to the left and the bear ran in! I told the rest id done my bit! Looking back now the group all agree that I did infact do my bit! ",

So, at times, his friends would go to the farm to be with him where they would go rabbit hunting. Hunting brought a lot of joy to his friends since they were city guys, but to him, there was nothing extraordinary about it since he'd grown up on a farm. So, they continued to do this for several years until one of his friends suggested that they go bear hunting. Although he wasn't too hyped up about this idea, he decided to go along. So, they flew to Canada, ended up on some lake, then hiked into the mountains until they reached the cabin where they would be staying. While there though, since it was quite spooky in the woods, his friends chickened out of bear hunting. So, they stayed in the cabin for a couple of days playing cards, eating and sleeping, but still just not being in the mood to go hunting for bears out of fear. However, one of the friends then said that there was no way that they could return back home without a bear otherwise they would be ridiculed. So, they decided that one of them would go hunt for the bear and the others would skin the bear and cut it into pieces. However, although the story-teller was still not super-stoked about this idea, sadly the bet fell on him to go out in the woods to hunt for the bear. So, he did and while in the woods, he encountered the biggest and oldest bear that he had ever seen. Sadly, he realised at he was about to shoot the bear that he had forgotten to load the rifle. So he ran for his life back to the cabin screaming for his friends to open the door with the bear hot on his heels. As the door opened, he took a sharp left turn and the bear ran straight into the cabin. Upon which he declared to his friends that he had done his part and brought the bear for them to skin...which they could not deny. The story concludes by saying that although this happened thirty years ago, none of his friends have ever suggested going bear-hunting again. ",

They went to the spot where they played cards, ate and slept. They questioned bear hunting, but one friend pointed out that they needed proof to show people back home. After what seems to be peer pressure, the group agreed on a game where the loser would go and hunt the bear and bring it back. Once back, the remaining friends would skin it and pack the bear to take home. The narrator friend lost the game and went out, he saw the bear and realised that the gun he had taken to shoot the bear wasn't loaded. He realised this, when he pointed the gun and tried to shoot. He ran back to the cabin with the bear closing in. Once he reached the cabin, he began screaming for the friends to open the door, he went in and turned left and the bear followed. He told his friends that his task was complete, he had brought the bear to them as agreed and now they had to skin and pack it. He was never asked to bear hunt again.  ",

Anyway, they got close in college and the man lived on the farm and the other three lived in the city. Because fo this, the three would love to come to the farm and help the man do chores or do \"macho\" stuff like hunting. They liked hunting squirrels and small things, but the man wasn't as interested because this was is regular life and it wasn't exciting. He went along with it because he wanted to be part of the group though. Later on, maybe a couple of years, the three friends wanted to go on a hunting trip to hunt bear, and although the man wasn't that interesting now either, he agreed to go for the same reason as before. So, they all went to the northern woods where one of the friends rented a cabin. On the journey, they encounter scary bears and the woods itself was scary, had to paddle for forever in kyaks, and when they got the cabin eventually they all decided to stay inside because they were spooked. Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back. They played a game to decide who would go out and shoot the bear and bring it back for the others to skin and pack. Funnily, the farmer man who didn't even want to go in the first place got the short end of the stick. He got a gun and went out though, as a man of his word. He happened to come across a bear, but it was a HUGE bear. Bigger than anything the man's seen or heard of. He tried to shoot it, but he realized he didn't load the gun. So, the only thing he could do was run because now he's angered the bear. He ran with the bear hot on his heels and went back to the cabin screaming for his three friends to open the door. They opened the door, he went inside, but the bear ended up following him in too. The man told his friends 'alright, I brought the bear to you guys to skin and pack'. It was a funny story and years later, his friends never invited him out to hunt again but knew he was a man of his word.",

He was not happy to go with it but decided to. They were in a cabin for 3/4 days without wanting to go bear hunting because the area was so spooky. Eventually, one of them psyched the boys to go bear hunting because everyone knew they had travelled to hunt for bears and it would be a bummer if they returned empty-handed. So they drew cards to decide who would go, and it fell on the storyteller, who never wanted to be there in the first place. His role was to hunt for the bear while the others skinned and prepared the bear to be taken home. As he went into the woods, he saw a big bear bigger than he had seen in pictures and tried to shoot at it. Unfortunately, his gun was not loaded so nothing happened and immediately he ran towards the cabin, trying to get away from the bear. The bear was very fast, and right behind his heel, even though he considered himself a fast runner. As he approached the cabin, he shouted at his friends to open the cabin door and let him in, and just as he drew near the door, he swiftly turned left, letting the bear into the cabin.

We said we had to hunt the bear though as the people at home would give us a hard time if we didnt come home with a bear as many people knew we went out hunting for a bear. So we agreed that whoever got a high card would have to go out and find the bear. Of course it was me who had to go and hunt the bear while the fellas would skin and pack the bear. For hours I was searching in the forest for the bear, then I heard a noise and it was behind me. The biggest bear I have ever seen, not even the pictures had them this big. So I pointed my gun at him and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened, I forgot the load this turkey. So I ran, I thought i was fast bust this bear was gaining on me.

Despite the narrator being reluctant, they still went along with it. The place they ended up going to was so spooky that they decided to stay in the cabin and not to go looking for a bear. They played cards and passed the time. After a a few days they decided to find a bear so they wouldn't lose face when they returned.

They’d come over to help out at the farm and although I didn’t enjoy it much, I went along with them to be with the group. They loved hunting rabbits so I’d join them. One day they mentioned that they wanted to hunt a bear up in Canada. I wasn’t really thrilled at the idea, but had no real reason as to why we couldn’t go. So we packed up and make our way to Canada. We landed in the water and then canoed as far as we could go. When we got to land, we had to walk 500 miles it seemed like. When we got to the cabin, the forest was spooky none of the guys wanted to venture outside. We stayed there for three or four days. We played cards, we ate, and we slept. One of the guys mentioned that we needed to bring a bear back since a lot of people knew we were coming to hunt bears. Now no one was looking to be the guy that went out in the spooky woods trying to hunt a bear. So me being the farmer went out into the woods. The others were going to skin the bear and prep it to take back with us. When I went outside, I saw the biggest bear anyone’s ever seen. I turned around and started back towards the cabin. Man I thought I was fast but the bear was gaining. As I got close to the cabin I started yelling OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR. When the guys opened the door, I took a quick left and quickly shut the door behind the bear. I shouted out, SKIN THE BEAR, I’LL GO FIND US ANOTHER ONE. Now this was 30 years ago.

Even thought this was not something I liked, I agreed to go as we are all part of the group and I didn't have a good excuse. So they planned a trip to the north woods in Canada, we flew up from Fort Wayne and landed on a lake. We hired some canoes to paddle as far as wee could, seemed like over a day. We then left the canoes and had a long hike to an old cabin they had rented. It seems like we must have hiked hundreds of miles.We settled into the cabin but didn't like the look of the woods, we all found it a bit spooky. So much that we would not go outside at night. We just chatted and played cards for several days. When it got near to the time of leaving, one of the guys thought we would be embarrassed not returning with a bear. As a group we decided to cut a deck of cards to decide who would hunt for a bear before I return. As you might guess I was the one who drew the high card, the one who didn't like hunting. I had to follow through, so it was agreed I would hunt the bear and the rest would skin and butcher the bear. I wen out with the old rifle to hunt a bear, it seemed like I wasn't going to find one. But I heard a noise and turned around to see a huge bear, the biggest bear I had seen even in pictures. I raised the rifle , aimed at the bear and pulled the trigger. Nothing, I had forgotten to load the rifle. The bear decided it was going to defend its territory and started towards me, I just turned and ran as fast as I could towards the cabin.

The group of us canoed up into the woods as far as we could go, and then backpacked the ret of the way... what felt like 500 miles... to a cabin that they rented. It was a really spooky place, and when we were there no one felt like actually going out and hunting. We ended up sleeping, eating and playing cards for three or four days. On the fourth or fifth day, one guy piped up and said that we better not go home empty handed when everyone knew that we were coming to hunt some bears. If we went home empty handed we would never hear the end of it. So we all decided that we would draw cards, and whoever got the highest would go out and hunt the bear, and the others would skin it and cut it into chunks to take home. Guess who drew the highest card... the guy who DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. But I had agreed to play the game. So I took the gun and went out. It felt like I had walked for hours and hours in those woods and found nothing. Eventually, I heard a noice behind me, I turned and saw the biggest bear I had ever seen. I had never even seen a bear that big in a PICTURE. And that old bear was not happy that I was in his territory. The only thing I could do was turn around and run run run, but that old bear was fast. He was right on my tail. When the cabin was in sight I started yelling \"Open the door, open the door\", with the bear hot on my tail. The guys opened the door, but before going in I quickly turned to the left, but the bear went straight inside. I closed the door and shouted THERE YOU HAVE YOUR BEAR.

After we'd been acquainted for several years, - Not given\n29. one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada. - \"One day, they decided to go hunt a bear,\"\n30.

I ran as hard as I could go, - \"The bear chased him back to the cabin,\"\n102. and I thought I used to be pretty fast, - Not given\n103. but that old bear, - Not given\n104. man he was gaining, - Not given\n105. he was just right on my heels ... - Not given\n106.

Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools - Not given\n8. and so we were acquainted - Not given\n9. But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school - Not given\n10. we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school - Not given\n11. and we became quite good friends - \"There was a guy that was friends with 4 people in college.\"\n12. I was the kid from the farm - \"He was from a farm\"\n13. the other three guys all lived in the city - \"while the other 3 were from the city.\"\n14. So being big macho men that we all were - Not given\n15. they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt - Not given\n16. and they'd come out - Not given\n17. and help me do chores and things like that - Not given\n18. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature - Not given\n19. I never really enjoyed hunting - Not given\n20. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors - \"but as for our main character from the farm he had enough the outdoors.\"\n21. wasn't all that exciting to me - \"but as for our main character from the farm he had enough the outdoors.\"\n22. But these guys got a big kick out of it - \"The city ones were really fascinated by the outdoors because they havent really experianced it much before\"\n23. so I'd go along just to be one of the group - Not given\n24. Things went on - Not given\n25. we did this for several years - Not given\n26. they were always coming out to the farm - Not given\n27. and hunting - Not given\n28. After we'd been acquainted for several years - Not given\n29. one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada - \"the 3 cit ones wanted to try hunting. The farm guy did not like the idea to much and didnt like it even more when he figured out they wanted to go bear hunting in canada.\"\n30. Now that didn't really appeal to me - \"The farm guy did not like the idea to much and didnt like it even more when he figured out they wanted to go bear hunting in canada.\"\n31. but I'd always been one of the group - Not given\n32. and I couldn't find any real reason not to go - \"He didnt back out of going though because he couldnt find a reason to say no.\"\n33. so I left them talk me into it - Not given\n34. wasn't too hepped up on this at all - Not given\n35. I don't care anything really much about hunting period - Not given\n36. let alone bear hunting - \"The farm guy did not like the idea to much and didnt like it even more when he figured out they wanted to go bear hunting in canada.\"\n37. Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me - Not given\n38. But as I said - Not given\n39. I left them talk me into it - Not given\n40. So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne - Not given\n41. and we flew way up into Canada some place - \"So the four of them end up going to Canada to try bear hunting.\"\n42. and we landed on a lake - Not given\n43. and then we rented canoes - Not given\n44. and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me - Not given\n45. 'till we got way up in the north woods - Not given\n46. Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes - Not given\n47. then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought - \"They have to backpack what feels like 500miles to get to the cabin they were going to be staying at.\"\n48. 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods - \"They have to backpack what feels like 500miles to get to the cabin they were going to be staying at.\"\n49. And after I got there - Not given\n50. I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started - Not given\n51. 'cause I didn't really need any part of that - Not given\n52. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you - \"But when everyone gets there its really spooky.\"\n53. So we got up there - \"So the four of them end up going to Canada to try bear hunting.\"\n54. and got set up in the cabin - Not given\n55. and ... got our groceries stored and everything - Not given\n56. And after we got to discussing it - Not given\n57. those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was - Not given\n58. We sat around there for three or four days - \"So instead of bear hunting the 4 guys decide to stay in the cabin and play card games for 4 days.\"\n59. played cards - \"So instead of bear hunting the 4 guys decide to stay in the cabin and play card games for 4 days.\"\n60. and ate - Not given\n61. and slept - Not given\n62. and we just couldn't ... - Not given\n63. no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear - Not given\n64. 'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place - \"But when everyone gets there its really spooky.\"\n65. We never ventured outside at night - \"They did not go outside at nighttime and hunkered down in the cabin.\"\n66. we stayed right there in the old cabin - \"They did not go outside at nighttime and hunkered down in the cabin.\"\n67. Well after we'd been there for three or four days - \"After 3-4 days though\"\n68. we got to talking it over - Not given\n69. and somebody said “Hey - Not given\n70. if we don't go out and hunt some bear ... - \"someone says \"people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest\".\"\n71. we've got to find a bear to take back home with us - \"someone says \"people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest\".\"\n72. or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people - \"someone says \"people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest\".\"\n73. 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting - \"someone says \"people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest\".\"\n74. and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time - \"someone says \"people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest\".\"\n75. Soo ... no one wanted to go out - Not given\n76. so we all decided that we'd cut the cards - \"So the group of friends decide that they need to get a bear. But because none of them want to they play a card game for it.\"\n77. Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear - \"The loser would have to get the bear\"\n78. and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down - \"and the winners would have to skin butcher and bag the bear meat.\"\n79. so we could take him home with us - \"and the winners would have to skin butcher and bag the bear meat.\"\n80. So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card - \"Our main character the one that didnt even want to be there in the first place loses\"\n81. the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place - \"Our main character the one that didnt even want to be there in the first place loses\"\n82. But I had agreed to play the game ... - Not given\n83. So ... I took the old gun - Not given\n84. and I go out bear hunting - \"So he sets out to find a bear in the forest.\"\n85. I didn't like this at all - Not given\n86. I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like - \"He spends hours out there looking for this bear\"\n87. and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything - \"He spends hours out there looking for this bear but cant find anything.\"\n88. and finally I heard a noise - Not given\n89. and I turned around - \"Eventually he turns around\"\n90. and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life - \"and sees a huge bear directly behind him.\"\n91. I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big - \"A bear bigger than any bear he has ever seen before even in pictures.\"\n92. I whipped up the gun - Not given\n93. and pulled the trigger - Not given\n94. and nothing happened - \"So he imeediatly tries to shoot the bear, but he forgot to load his gun.\"\n95. I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey - \"So he imeediatly tries to shoot the bear, but he forgot to load his gun.\"\n96. Well he had ... - Not given\n97. he just had no desires to have me in his territory - Not given\n98. and he made for me - Not given\n99. Well there was nothing for me to do but run - \"So in panic the only thing he can do is run.\"\n100. and I turned around - Not given\n101. I ran as hard as I could go - \"He starts running as fast as he could.\"\n102. and I thought I used to be pretty fast - \"He recalls being a fast runner in the past\"\n103. but that old bear - Not given\n104. man he was gaining - \"but the old bear is still gaining on him.\"\n105. he was just right on my heels ... - \"but the old bear is still gaining on him.\"\n106. And when I got within sight of that cabin - Not given\n107. I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR - \"As he is getting closer to the cabin where everyone else is he yells \"OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN DOOR\".\"\n108. OPEN THE DOOR!” - \"As he is getting closer to the cabin where everyone else is he yells \"OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN DOOR\".\"\n109. Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go - Not given\n110. and that old bear right on my tail - Not given\n111. and they opened the door - \"The other guys open the door for him\"\n112. and I got right to the cabin door - Not given\n113. I made a quick turn to the left - Not given\n114. and that old bear went right on in - Not given\n115. I just reached back - Not given\n116. and pulled the door shut - Not given\n117. and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS - \"and close the door behind him locking the bear out and says,\"\n118. YOU SKIN HIM - \"Well I brought you guy the bear, you better get to skinning\".\"\n119. I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!” - Not given\n120. Now all this happened thirty years ago - \"After 30 years\"\n121. and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment - \"the 3 guys still say he completed his task of bringing a bear back.\"\n122.

Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature - \"to hunt small animals\"\n19. I never really enjoyed hunting - \"even though the narrator did not enjoy hunting\"\n20. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors - Not given\n21. wasn't all that exciting to me - Not given\n22. But these guys got a big kick out of it - Not given\n23. so I'd go along just to be one of the group - \"he went along with it to please his macho city mates\"\n24. Things went on - Not given\n25. we did this for several years - Not given\n26. they were always coming out to the farm - Not given\n27. and hunting - \"They would often meet and go to the farm to hunt small animals\"\n28. After we'd been acquainted for several years - Not given\n29. one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada - \"One time they decided to go on a hunting trip to Canada to hunt bears\"\n30. Now that didn't really appeal to me - Not given\n31. but I'd always been one of the group - Not given\n32. and I couldn't find any real reason not to go - Not given\n33. so I left them talk me into it - Not given\n34. wasn't too hepped up on this at all - Not given\n35.

I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started - Not given\n51. 'cause I didn't really need any part of that - Not given\n52. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you - Not given\n53. So we got up there - \"they arrived at their cabin\"\n54. and got set up in the cabin - \"set it up with groceries etc\"\n55. and ... got our groceries stored and everything - \"set it up with groceries etc\"\n56. And after we got to discussing it - Not given\n57. those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was - Not given\n58.

Well after we'd been there for three or four days - Not given\n68. we got to talking it over - Not given\n69. and somebody said “Hey - Not given\n70. if we don't go out and hunt some bear ... - \"Eventually they decided they would have to go out to hunt for a bear\"\n71. we've got to find a bear to take back home with us - Not given\n72. or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people - Not given\n73. 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting - Not given\n74. and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time - Not given\n75. Soo ... no one wanted to go out - Not given\n76. so we all decided that we'd cut the cards - \"they decided to draw cards\"\n77. Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear - \"to choose who would go out to hunt and kill the bear\"\n78. and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down - \"The remaining three would skin and cut up the bear\"\n79. so we could take him home with us - Not given\n80. So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card - Not given\n81. the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place - Not given\n82. But I had agreed to play the game ... - Not given\n83.

Well he had ... - Not given\n97. he just had no desires to have me in his territory - Not given\n98. and he made for me - \"Startled, the bear charged at him\"\n99. Well there was nothing for me to do but run - \"the narrator started sprinting back towards the cabin\"\n100. and I turned around - Not given\n101. I ran as hard as I could go - \"the narrator started sprinting back towards the cabin\"\n102. and I thought I used to be pretty fast - Not given\n103. but that old bear - Not given\n104. man he was gaining - \"with the bear closing in\"\n105. he was just right on my heels ... - \"with the bear closing in\"\n106.

Hunting brought a lot of joy to his friends since they were city guys, but to him, there was nothing extraordinary about it since he'd grown up on a farm.\n7. So, they continued to do this for several years until one of his friends suggested that they go bear hunting.\n8. Although he wasn't too hyped up about this idea, he decided to go along.\n9. So, they flew to Canada, ended up on some lake, then hiked into the mountains until they reached the cabin where they would be staying.\n10. While there though, since it was quite spooky in the woods, his friends chickened out of bear hunting.\n11. So, they stayed in the cabin for a couple of days playing cards, eating and sleeping, but still just not being in the mood to go hunting for bears out of fear.\n12. However, one of the friends then said that there was no way that they could return back home without a bear otherwise they would be ridiculed.\n13. So, they decided that one of them would go hunt for the bear and the others would skin the bear and cut it into pieces.\n14. However, although the story-teller was still not super-stoked about this idea, sadly the bet fell on him to go out in the woods to hunt for the bear.\n15. So, he did and while in the woods, he encountered the biggest and oldest bear that he had ever seen.\n16. Sadly, he realised at he was about to shoot the bear that he had forgotten to load the rifle.\n17. So he ran for his life back to the cabin screaming for his friends to open the door with the bear hot on his heels.\n18. As the door opened, he took a sharp left turn and the bear ran straight into the cabin.\n19. Upon which he declared to his friends that he had done his part and brought the bear for them to skin...which they could not deny.\n20. The story concludes by saying that although this happened thirty years ago, none of his friends have ever suggested going bear-hunting again.",

Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back.\n11.

But after being apart of the group for so long\n10. the 3 city ones wanted to try hunting.\n11. The farm guy did not like the idea too much\n12. and didnt like it even more when he figured out they wanted to go bear hunting in canada.\n13.

After driving for as long as they could drive to get to their destination\n17. the road ends.\n18. They have to backpack what feels like 500miles to get to the cabin they were going to be staying at.\n19. But when everyone gets there its really spooky.\n20. The cabin is old\n21. and they are in the middle of no where.\n22. So instead of bear hunting the 4 guys decide to stay in the cabin and play card games for 4 days.\n23. They did not go outside at nighttime\n24. and hunkered down in the cabin.\n25. After 3-4 days though someone says \"people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest\".\n26. So the group of friends decide that they need to get a bear.\n27. But because none of them want to they play a card game for it.\n28. The loser would have to get the bear\n29. and the winners would have to skin butcher and bag the bear meat.\n30. Our main character the one that didnt even want to be there in the first place loses\n31. and has to go hunt a bear.\n32. So he sets out to find a bear in the forest.\n33.

A bear bigger than any bear he has ever seen before even in pictures.\n38. So he immediately tries to shoot the bear,\n39. but he forgot to load his gun.\n40.

I grew up in a farm and from a village\n9. while the other three were from the city.\n10. We used to go hunting while we were free\n11. and they used to come to my farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels.\n12. I was not very interested as it was not new for me,\n13. but they really enjoyed it.\n14. Once they mentioned they were all done with rabbit hunting\n15. and we should go bear hunting.\n16. I was not hepped up about it,\n17. but since I was part of the group I let them talk me into it.\n18. So we flew out of the airport from Fort Wayne\n19. into some part of Canada\n20. and landed on a lake.\n21. From there, we went hiking for about 500 miles into the north woods.\n22. We had to reach a cabin where we would stay.\n23. We reached the cabin\n24. and it was a spooky place.\n25. We did not go bear hunting\n26. and all for three days was play cards and drink.\n27. After 3 days one of the friends said we need to go bear hunting\n28. as many people from our place knew we had gone to hunt a bear\n29. and if we returned empty handed it would not be good for us.\n30. so we need to get a bear\n31. and either hunt it or take one back to our place.\n32. I was not interested to go.\n33. It was decided to play a game of cards\n34. and whoever had the highest number at the end of the game would go to hunt the bear\n35. and the other three will stay and do the skinning and cutting the meat so it can be taken back with us.\n36. So the card game started\n37. and guess who had the highest card!\n38. the one who was least interested in hunting the bear.\n39. Yes, then I picked up a gun\n40. and left to hunt the bear on my own.\n41. I kept walking but there was nothing to be found,\n42. after quite a while, I heard a noise,\n43. when I went to check I saw the biggest old bear I had ever seen in my life.\n44. It did not look happy to see me in its territory.\n45. I took out the gun, aimed to shoot,\n46. when I pressed the trigger nothing happened,\n47. I realised the gun was not loaded\n48. and made a run for it.\n49. I ran as hard as I could,\n50. but the bear was closing in on my heels,\n51. after coming out of the woods, I could see the cabin\n52. and I shouted OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!\n53. as I reached the door and turned left and closed the door.\n54. I shouted to my friends, I got the bear its outside,\n55. now go and skin it and cut the meat out of it.\n56.

We found out that we were in the same school.\n6. The four of us became good friends.\n7. Now I’m a farm boy.\n8. I grew up on a farm.\n9. The other three were city guys.\n10. They’d come over to help out at the farm.\n11. Although I didn’t enjoy it much, I went along with them to be with the group.\n12. They loved hunting rabbits.\n13. I’d join them.\n14. One day they mentioned that they wanted to hunt a bear up in Canada.\n15. I wasn’t really thrilled at the idea.\n16. I had no real reason as to why we couldn’t go.\n17. So we packed up and make our way to Canada.\n18. We landed in the water.\n19. We then canoed as far as we could go.\n20. When we got to land, we had to walk 500 miles it seemed like.\n21. When we got to the cabin, the forest was spooky.\n22. None of the guys wanted to venture outside.\n23. We stayed there for three or four days.\n24. We played cards.\n25. We ate.\n26. We slept.\n27. One of the guys mentioned that we needed to bring a bear back since a lot of people knew we were coming to hunt bears.\n28. Now no one was looking to be the guy that went out in the spooky woods trying to hunt a bear.\n29. So me being the farmer went out into the woods.\n30. The others were going to skin the bear and prep it to take back with us.\n31. When I went outside, I saw the biggest bear anyone’s ever seen.\n32. I turned around and started back towards the cabin.\n33. I thought I was fast.\n34. The bear was gaining.\n35. As I got close to the cabin I started yelling OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR.\n36. When the guys opened the door, I took a quick left.\n37. I quickly shut the door behind the bear.\n38. I shouted out, SKIN THE BEAR, I’LL GO FIND US ANOTHER ONE.\n39. Now this was 30 years ago.\n40.

They all used to enjoy visiting the farm to help out as they were all quite physical.\n6. They also like to go hunting for rabbits and the like.\n7. Although, even growing up on a farm I did not like hunting.\n8. We would often meet up.\n9. But after several years one of the guys said about going bear hunting.\n10. Even thought this was not something I liked, I agreed to go as we are all part of the group and I didn't have a good excuse.\n11. So they planned a trip to the north woods in Canada, we flew up from Fort Wayne and landed on a lake.\n12. We hired some canoes to paddle as far as wee could, seemed like over a day.\n13. We then left the canoes and had a long hike to an old cabin they had rented.\n14. It seems like we must have hiked hundreds of miles.\n15. We settled into the cabin but didn't like the look of the woods, we all found it a bit spooky.\n16. So much that we would not go outside at night.\n17. We just chatted and played cards for several days.\n18. When it got near to the time of leaving, one of the guys thought we would be embarrassed not returning with a bear.\n19. As a group we decided to cut a deck of cards to decide who would hunt for a bear before I return.\n20. As you might guess I was the one who drew the high card, the one who didn't like hunting.\n21. I had to follow through, so it was agreed I would hunt the bear and the rest would skin and butcher the bear.\n22. I wen out with the old rifle to hunt a bear, it seemed like I wasn't going to find one.\n23. But I heard a noise and turned around to see a huge bear, the biggest bear I had seen even in pictures.\n24. I raised the rifle , aimed at the bear and pulled the trigger.\n25. Nothing, I had forgotten to load the rifle.\n26. The bear decided it was going to defend its territory and started towards me, I just turned and ran as fast as I could towards the cabin.\n27. Even though in good shape the bear was gaining.\n28. Finally the cabin was inside, I shouted for help, called for them to open the door.\n29. The bear was almost on me as a reached the door.\n30. But rather than go in i swerved to the left of the door, the bear couldn't stop and ran straight into the cabin.\n31. I quickly closed the door and called to the guys, over to you, I have hunted the bear, now it is your turn to process the bear.\n32. This is what happened over 30 years ago.\n33.

They flew up from Fort Worth into Canada with a view to canoeing up to the Great North Woods.\n6. They canoed some great distance and then backpacked up to a cabin that they had rented.\n7.

We decided whoever had the highest card number was the one to hunt the bear needless to say I was the guy who ended up with the job.\n11.

Obviously he was the guy who ended up with the highest number.\n9. He took an old turkey gun and set of the woods to hunt.\n10. He came across a big old looking bear and when he was ready to fire, the gun didn't because he had failed to load it back then.\n11. He had no other choice than to run, and by doing so the bear chased him all the way to the cabin where he screamed and shouted for them to let him in.\n12.

The narrator did not enjoy hunting,\n12. but went along with it for the sake of his friends.\n13. One day they decided to set off on a trip to Canada bear hunting.\n14. They took a plane\n15. and then canoed and hiked for many many miles\n16. until they reached the cabin in the depth of the woods.\n17. Finally realised that they did not want to go out in the night hunting\n18. as it was very dark and deserted.\n19. They played cards and ate and slept.\n20. However, they realised that they would need to take a bear home\n21. to prove to people that they had been hunting.\n22. They drew cards to see who would go out for the bear\n23. and the other three would then skin the bear and pack it to take it home.\n24.
