  "narrative": "This is a story about three of my friends that I met in 1949 when I started college. Actually I met them before that, we became friends after we all... went to school at the same place. Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools, and so we were acquainted. But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school, we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school, and we became quite good friends. I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city. So being big macho men that we all were, they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt, and they'd come out, and help me do chores and things like that. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature. I never really enjoyed hunting. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors, wasn't all that exciting to me. But these guys got a big kick out of it, so I'd go along just to be one of the group. Things went on, we did this for several years, they were always coming out to the farm, and hunting. After we'd been acquainted for several years, one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada. Now that didn't really appeal to me, but I'd always been one of the group, and I couldn't find any real reason not to go, so I left them talk me into it, wasn't too hepped up on this at all. I don't care anything really much about hunting period, let alone bear hunting. Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me. But as I said, I left them talk me into it. So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne, and we flew way up into Canada some place, and we landed on a lake, and then we rented canoes, and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me, 'till we got way up in the north woods. Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes, then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought, 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods. And after I got there, I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started, 'cause I didn't really need any part of that. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you. So we got up there, and got set up in the cabin, and ... got our groceries stored and everything. And after we got to discussing it those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was. We sat around there for three or four days, played cards, and ate, and slept, and we just couldn't ... no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear 'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place. We never ventured outside at night, we stayed right there in the old cabin. Well after we'd been there for three or four days, we got to talking it over, and somebody said “Hey, if we don't go out and hunt some bear ... we've got to find a bear to take back home with us, or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people, 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting, and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.” Soo ... no one wanted to go out, so we all decided that we'd cut the cards. Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear, and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down, so we could take him home with us. So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card, the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place. But I had agreed to play the game ... So ... I took the old gun, and I go out bear hunting. I didn't like this at all. I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like, and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything, and finally I heard a noise, and I turned around, and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life, I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big. I whipped up the gun, and pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey. Well he had ... he just had no desires to have me in his territory, and he made for me. Well there was nothing for me to do but run, and I turned around, I ran as hard as I could go, and I thought I used to be pretty fast, but that old bear, man he was gaining, he was just right on my heels ... And when I got within sight of that cabin I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR OPEN THE DOOR!” Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go, and that old bear right on my tail, and they opened the door, and I got right to the cabin door, I made a quick turn to the left, and that old bear went right on in. I just reached back, and pulled the door shut, and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS, YOU SKIN HIM, I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!” Now all this happened thirty years ago, and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment. But can you BELIEVE, they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.",

They had previously been acquainted as high school athletes, but once they entered school together, they all became friends. The man was a farm boy and his friends were all from the city, so they came to his family's farm to hunt and help out with chores. One day, they decided to go hunt a bear, and the man joined them even though he didn't really want to.\n\nThey took a plane up to Canada, and then took their canoes on a big lake, travelled that way for a few days, and then backpacked another 500 miles or so until they reached the cabin they had rented. The area around the cabin was a spooky wood, so they were afraid to go out into the woods.\n\nEventually, they decided that, since everyone was expecting them to bring home a bear, that they had to actually go out and hunt. They drew cards to determine who was going to go out and get the bear (the rest would skin and pack it), and it was the narrator who was chosen. He went out with his gun and found a massive bear, but when he went to shoot it, he found he had forgotten to load his gun. The bear chased him back to the cabin, and his friends opened the door for him just in time.\n\nIt has been 30 years since then, and his friends haven't invited him to go hunting again.",

We were all on the same athletics team.The other 3 lived in the city however I was brought up on a farm and they liked to come up to the farm to help with chores and hunt. As we grew up we were talking one day and someone mentioned about going bear hunting however I really didn’t want to go. I also didn’t want to disappoint the group so I agreed to go even through I didn’t want to. So we took a flight to the canal where we then had to use canoes to get to the bottom of the mountain which seemed to take forever. Once we got to the mountain we then had to walk what felt like 5 days to get to the cabin. Once we got to the cabin we realised how scary the place was so we decided to stay inside and not go out so we stayed in the cabin playing cards. Towards the end of the break we realised if we didn’t take a bear home with us we would be talked about unkindly so we decided that we would cut cards and whoever got the highest would be the one to go get a bear and the remaining 3 would be the ones to skin the bear ready to take home. Unluckily it was me who got the highest card so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear. I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!) I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded. So I ran and ran back towards the cabin. When the cabin was in sight I shouted “open the door” when the door opened I moved to the left and the bear ran in! I told the rest id done my bit! Looking back now the group all agree that I did infact do my bit! ",

Although they met in college, they previously knew each other though from high school days.So, when they met in college, that is when they became close.\nThis particular guy grew up on a farm, however, his three friends grew up in the city. So, at times, his friends would go to the farm to be with him where they would go rabbit hunting. Hunting brought a lot of joy to his friends since they were city guys, but to him, there was nothing extraordinary about it since he'd grown up on a farm. So, they continued to do this for several years until one of his friends suggested that they go bear hunting. Although he wasn't too hyped up about this idea, he decided to go along. So, they flew to Canada, ended up on some lake, then hiked into the mountains until they reached the cabin where they would be staying. While there though, since it was quite spooky in the woods, his friends chickened out of bear hunting. So, they stayed in the cabin for a couple of days playing cards, eating and sleeping, but still just not being in the mood to go hunting for bears out of fear. However, one of the friends then said that there was no way that they could return back home without a bear otherwise they would be ridiculed. So, they decided that one of them would go hunt for the bear and the others would skin the bear and cut it into pieces. However, although the story-teller was still not super-stoked about this idea, sadly the bet fell on him to go out in the woods to hunt for the bear. So, he did and while in the woods, he encountered the biggest and oldest bear that he had ever seen. Sadly, he realised at he was about to shoot the bear that he had forgotten to load the rifle. So he ran for his life back to the cabin screaming for his friends to open the door with the bear hot on his heels. As the door opened, he took a sharp left turn and the bear ran straight into the cabin. Upon which he declared to his friends that he had done his part and brought the bear for them to skin...which they could not deny. The story concludes by saying that although this happened thirty years ago, none of his friends have ever suggested going bear-hunting again. ",

Anyway, they got close in college and the man lived on the farm and the other three lived in the city. Because fo this, the three would love to come to the farm and help the man do chores or do \"macho\" stuff like hunting. They liked hunting squirrels and small things, but the man wasn't as interested because this was is regular life and it wasn't exciting. He went along with it because he wanted to be part of the group though. Later on, maybe a couple of years, the three friends wanted to go on a hunting trip to hunt bear, and although the man wasn't that interesting now either, he agreed to go for the same reason as before. So, they all went to the northern woods where one of the friends rented a cabin. On the journey, they encounter scary bears and the woods itself was scary, had to paddle for forever in kyaks, and when they got the cabin eventually they all decided to stay inside because they were spooked. Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back. They played a game to decide who would go out and shoot the bear and bring it back for the others to skin and pack. Funnily, the farmer man who didn't even want to go in the first place got the short end of the stick. He got a gun and went out though, as a man of his word. He happened to come across a bear, but it was a HUGE bear. Bigger than anything the man's seen or heard of. He tried to shoot it, but he realized he didn't load the gun. So, the only thing he could do was run because now he's angered the bear. He ran with the bear hot on his heels and went back to the cabin screaming for his three friends to open the door. They opened the door, he went inside, but the bear ended up following him in too. The man told his friends 'alright, I brought the bear to you guys to skin and pack'.

He was not happy to go with it but decided to. They were in a cabin for 3/4 days without wanting to go bear hunting because the area was so spooky. Eventually, one of them psyched the boys to go bear hunting because everyone knew they had travelled to hunt for bears and it would be a bummer if they returned empty-handed. So they drew cards to decide who would go, and it fell on the storyteller, who never wanted to be there in the first place. His role was to hunt for the bear while the others skinned and prepared the bear to be taken home. As he went into the woods, he saw a big bear bigger than he had seen in pictures and tried to shoot at it. Unfortunately, his gun was not loaded so nothing happened and immediately he ran towards the cabin, trying to get away from the bear. The bear was very fast, and right behind his heel, even though he considered himself a fast runner. As he approached the cabin, he shouted at his friends to open the cabin door and let him in, and just as he drew near the door, he swiftly turned left, letting the bear into the cabin.

They landed on a lake, paddled in a canoe for what seemed like a day and a half, and then hiked what seemed like 500 miles before arriving at a cabin in the woods that they had rented. \n\nUpon settling down in the cabin, they all decided that they weren't exactly hyped up about going bear hunting. So for the next three or four days, they stayed indoors, played card games, and ate. On the third or fourth day, one of them brought it up that they had to get a bear so as not to disappoint the people waiting for them back at home. \n\nTo decide who goes out to hunt the bear, they drew cards. The person with the highest card had to go hunt the bear, while the others would skin it and prepare it for travel. After they drew cards, it turned out it was the man who did not even want to go in the first place that got the highest card. \n\nHe took the old gun and set out. After what seemed like hours, he heard a growl behind and looked back to see the biggest bear he had ever seen in his life. He picked up the gun and fired, but nothing happened. Turned out he had forgotten to load the gun. He turned on his heels and started running as fast as he could, with the bear on his heels. When he got in sight of the cabin, he started shouting for them to open the door. \n\nThe door opened, but instead of going in, he took a left around the cabin, while the bear went straight inside. He quickly closed the cabin door and told his friends that he had brought the bear, it was their turn to skin it. Eventually, they agreed that he actually played his part. \n\nAlthough this happened 30 years ago, they never asked him to go hunting since that day. ",

We had to reach a cabin where we would stay. \nWe reached the cabin and it was a spooky place. We did not go bear hunting and all for three days was play cards and drink. After 3 days one of the friends said we need to go bear hunting as many people from our place knew we had gone to hunt a bear and if we returned empty handed it would not be good for us. so we need to get a bear and either hunt it or take one back to our place. \nI was not interested to go. It was decided to play a game of cards and whoever had the highest number at the end of the game would go to hunt the bear and the other three will stay and do the skinning and cutting the meat so it can be taken back with us.\nSo the card game started and guess who had the highest card! the one who was least interested in hunting the bear. \nYes, then I picked up a gun and left to hunt the bear on my own. I kept walking but there was nothing to be found, after quite a while, I heard a noise, when I went to check I saw the biggest old bear I had ever seen in my life. It did not look happy to see me in its territory. I took out the gun, aimed to shoot, when I pressed the trigger nothing happened, I realised the gun was not loaded and made a run for it. \nI ran as hard as I could, but the bear was closing in on my heels, after coming out of the woods, I could see the cabin and I shouted OPEN THE DOOR!

We never left the cabin until one of them said that one of us has to go out and shoot a bear because lots of people know that we went bear hunting and it would be embarrassing to go back without a bear. So we had to draw straws and guess who got the short straw? me. The person who does not like to hunt and did not want even come on this trip. So of I went into the forest and came across the biggest bear that I have ever seen. This bear was so big that I have not even seen pictures of a bear so big.

And WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED, but it was the guy who didn't even want to go hunting in the first place. But I had agreed to this process. So I took our shotgun, went out and walked for hours but didn't find anything, when suddenly I heard a noise, and turned to see the biggest old bear I have ever seen. I aimed my gun and shot it at it, but then realisd I had forgotten to load it! But the bear didn't like having me in its territory, so it came after me. I turned and ran. I thought I was pretty fast, but the old bear was gaining on me. I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin, yelling \"OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR\".

So after a plane flight and a hike for what seemed like hundreds of miles over many days, they arrived at their cabin, set it up with groceries etc and settled in for a few days.\n\nEventually they decided they would have to go out to hunt for a bear, although by now they did not want to.

I didn't have much interest in hunting as I grew up on a farm and was used to these activities but no longer excited by them.\n\nAnyway after a number of hunting trips the other guys suggested we all fly to Canada and try to hunt a bear. Again I wasn't particularly keen to do this but I agreed to go anyway. We flew over to Canada out of Fort Wayne and when we landed we had to paddle in canoes for what seemed like two days. Once back on land we had to trek for a further 500 miles. The guys had rented a cabin in the woods and we had supplies for a few nights. \n\nThe strange thing is, we didn't go hunting. We just stayed in the cabin, eating, sleeping and playing cards. The woods were really spooky up there and it seemed that the guys had lost all interest in hunting a bear so we just stayed in the cabin. Towards to the end of our stay one of the guys said we're going to look stupid if we don't come back with a bear so we decided to draw cards to see who would venture into the woods to kill the bear. The other guys would have the job of skinning and cutting the meat. Anyway we drew our cards and can you believe it? The guy who didn't want to go in the first place drew the bear card. So out I went into the spooky woods and I looked for a bear. Suddenly I looked up and saw a bear and it was huge. I've never even seen a picture of a bear so big and here was one starring right at me. I whipped up the shotgun and pulled the trigger but nothing happened. Like a complete turkey I had only forgot to load the damn thing. Well that bear was furious and he did not want me on his turf so I turned and ran like hell. I saw the cabin up ahead and screamed at the guys to open the door. I jumped into the cabin and ran to the left then shouted, here's the bear I promised.

The other two loved the out doors and convinced their friend to go bear hunting with them. He wasn't that interested in hunting, but allowed himself to be convinced. The three friends took a plane from Fort Worth and travelled to a cabin in the north woods. The place was so spooky none of them felt like hunting, so they spent the majority of the time playing cards, eating and sleeping. They eventually decided that at least one of them should hunt and kill a bear so as not to face ridicule back home by returning empty-handed. So they cut cards to decide who would go and the farmworker drew the highest card. He went out, despite having had no desire to go on the hunting trip, and came across a large bear. He attempted to shoot it, but discovered he's forgotten to load his rifle. The bear then chased him back through the woods and all the while he was shouting to his friends to open the cabin door for him.

In all the activities done in the farm, they wee mostly interested in hunting. The interest grew to the point of them suggesting that we go bear hunting in the woods of Canada. I did not like the idea but because we are friends I let them convince me otherwise. So, we booked a flight to go there and stayed in an old creepy cabin. For the first couple of days, we were settling in and playing games. At some point, the idea of bear hunting grew and we started talking about it again. There was some indecision about who was going to out and hunt the bear. To solve the problem, we played a game of cards and whomever accumulated the most points will be the one going out. I was the one who did, the person who was not interested in going there in the first place. I went out in the woods, for same time it was very quite with not activity. I heard a sound and as I turned to see where it came from, a huge bear was staring at me. I was very scared and the first instinct was to shoot. Unfortunately I did not load the gun and in a state of panic I resorted to running. It was in that moment, I realized that I was not much of a fast runner. the bear was right behind me. I managed to get to the cabin, and shouted, signaling my friends to open.  They did just that but the bear came in with me. I declared that I had did my part and it was time for them to do theirs.

But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school,\n10. we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,\n11. and we became quite good friends.\n12. I was the kid from the farm,\n13. the other three guys all lived in the city.\n14. So being big macho men that we all were,\n15. they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt,\n16. and they'd come out,\n17. and help me do chores and things like that.\n18. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.\n19. I never really enjoyed hunting.\n20. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,\n21. wasn't all that exciting to me.\n22. But these guys got a big kick out of it,\n23. so I'd go along just to be one of the group.\n24. Things went on,\n25. we did this for several years,\n26. they were always coming out to the farm,\n27. and hunting.\n28. After we'd been acquainted for several years,\n29. one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada.\n30. Now that didn't really appeal to me,\n31. but I'd always been one of the group,\n32. and I couldn't find any real reason not to go,\n33. so I left them talk me into it,\n34. wasn't too hepped up on this at all.\n35. I don't care anything really much about hunting period,\n36. let alone bear hunting.\n37. Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me.\n38. But as I said,\n39. I left them talk me into it.\n40. So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne,\n41. and we flew way up into Canada some place,\n42. and we landed on a lake,\n43. and then we rented canoes,\n44. and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me,\n45. 'till we got way up in the north woods.\n46. Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes,\n47. then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought,\n48. 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.\n49. And after I got there,\n50. I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started,\n51. 'cause I didn't really need any part of that.\n52. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.\n53. So we got up there,\n54. and got set up in the cabin,\n55. and ... got our groceries stored and everything.\n56. And after we got to discussing it\n57. those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was.\n58. We sat around there for three or four days,\n59. played cards,\n60. and ate,\n61. and slept,\n62. and we just couldn't ...\n63. no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear\n64. 'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place.\n65. We never ventured outside at night,\n66. we stayed right there in the old cabin.\n67. Well after we'd been there for three or four days,\n68. we got to talking it over,\n69. and somebody said “Hey,\n70. if we don't go out and hunt some bear ...\n71. we've got to find a bear to take back home with us,\n72. or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people,\n73. 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting,\n74. and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”\n75. Soo ... no one wanted to go out,\n76. so we all decided that we'd cut the cards.\n77. Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear,\n78. and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down,\n79. so we could take him home with us.\n80. So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card,\n81. the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place.\n82. But I had agreed to play the game ...\n83. So ... I took the old gun,\n84. and I go out bear hunting.\n85. I didn't like this at all.\n86. I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like,\n87. and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything,\n88. and finally I heard a noise,\n89. and I turned around,\n90. and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life,\n91. I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big.\n92. I whipped up the gun,\n93. and pulled the trigger,\n94. and nothing happened.\n95. I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey.\n96. Well he had ...\n97. he just had no desires to have me in his territory,\n98. and he made for me.\n99. Well there was nothing for me to do but run,\n100. and I turned around,\n101. I ran as hard as I could go,\n102. and I thought I used to be pretty fast,\n103. but that old bear,\n104. man he was gaining,\n105. he was just right on my heels ...\n106. And when I got within sight of that cabin\n107. I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!”\n108. Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go,\n109. and that old bear right on my tail,\n110. and they opened the door,\n111. and I got right to the cabin door,\n112. I made a quick turn to the left,\n113. and that old bear went right on in.\n114. I just reached back,\n115. and pulled the door shut,\n116. and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS,\n117. YOU SKIN HIM,\n118. I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”\n119. Now all this happened thirty years ago,\n120. and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment.\n121. But can you BELIEVE,\n122. they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.",

As he went into the woods, he saw a big bear bigger than he had seen in pictures and tried to shoot at it.\n12. Unfortunately, his gun was not loaded so nothing happened and immediately he ran towards the cabin, trying to get away from the bear.\n13. The bear was very fast, and right behind his heel, even though he considered himself a fast runner.\n14. As he approached the cabin, he shouted at his friends to open the cabin door and let him in, and just as he drew near the door, he swiftly turned left, letting the bear into the cabin.\n15.

They packed their bags\n15. and headed over to a cabin that seemed a couple of days away,\n16. they had to canoe up there\n17. eventually they arrived.\n18. Luckily for Farm Boy the other guys also did not feel like bear hunting when they got to the cabin,\n19. all they did was eat and sleep.\n20. Until one day they decided they had to take home a bear to show the other people that they went hunting to save their reputation.\n21. It was decided to make a draw\n22. and farm boy was the one who won the card to go hunting.\n23. He went hunting with his gun\n24. and sat out for almost an entire day without seeing a bear\n25. when eventually the biggest bear he ever saw appeared behind him.\n26. He tried to draw his gun\n27. but he had not loaded it,\n28. the bear started chasing him\n29. and it was swift.\n30. He eventually saw the cabin\n31. and started shouting they must open.\n32. Which they did,\n33. however instead of going in he swung to the right\n34. and the bear went right inside.\n35. He closed the door\n36. and said the guys got their bear\n37. and they must deal with it.\n38. This was 30yrs ago\n39. and the guys never asked him to go hunting again.",

The bulk of the time they played cards and did not go out at night.\n8. They felt that they had to have some thing to bring back and drew cards to decide who would go out and get the bear.\n9. The farm boy went out but had not loaded his rifle.\n10. He found a bear that chased him all the way back to the cabin.\n11. He yelled to them to open the cabin door and the bear rushed into the cabin.\n12. He announced that he had delivered the bear and joked that he was going back for another one.\n13.

By this time my 3 friends were not as mad keen as they were about hunting bear.\n9. We sat around eating and playing cards however we knew that because we had talked about bear hunting so much before we came we knew we had to take one back or we would be totally ridiculed on our return.\n10. We decided whoever had the highest card number was the one to hunt the bear needless to say I was the guy who ended up with the job.\n11. When I eventually came across a bear, I could not believe how big it was when I fired my gun I had forgot to load it so had to make a run for it chased by the bear.\n12.

Because they fear others they decided they should return with a dead bear\n6. so using a high card decider the narrator who didn't want to do any of this got the metaphorical short straw.\n7. He found an old bear,\n8. took a shot with an unloaded gun\n9. and they did the thing you must never ever do and that is run away from a bear.\n10. He ran to the cabin\n11. and I can't remember how it ends.",
