  "narrative": "My daughter died. It’ll be twenty-eight years this month. The thirtieth of this month, yeah. She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed. See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed. So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that. So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.” And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm. She was operated on in March – No, April! So that was the thirtieth. She was operated – ten days before, so that would be the twentieth. The twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly. Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm. She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is. They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board. And to make sure I brought her girdle to put on. I said, “All right, I’ll be right over.” And I went. But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know. She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She was a lady doctor. So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready. My husband was waiting for her. He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting. “When is the mother coming?” The hospital kept calling. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie? She’s discharged.” And Rita said “That’s strange, the mother went to the hospital. She should be there.” So they came back to the hospital to look for us. Rita said, “Gee, that’s strange,” she said, “Mother must’ve gotten really worked up about Marie.” You know, I’ve always had a bad heart. “Mother must’ve gotten so upset about Marie, she probably made herself sick,” Rita thought. So she came over with my son-in-law, in the car. And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything. They had to grab me. Then they brought me to the office, see. When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” I said, “We lost Marie. Marie died.” Well, that’s this one. This is a picture of Rita. She went down like lightning. Dropped to the floor, and that’s a marble floor. She went down like lightning. And the back of her leg, it felt just like a pole. Hard like a pole, the back of her leg. And that girl is suffering. Thirty – no, twenty-eight years since her sister died? When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it. She suffers – seven, eight, nine weeks at a time. She can’t walk, she goes through such pain since then. And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed. Later, they said it was a blood clot. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.” I wouldn’t let them touch her. So when I got home – they took me home. I was screaming in the car. I couldn’t get out, you know, I couldn’t – I was screaming! Everybody came out, coming out of their doors because they could hear the screams. My husband was sitting on the step. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?” Well, my hair was all pulled, and my face – I was a mess. I didn’t know what I had done to myself. I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack. Then my son, Michael, yeah. That night. Right there, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed. He had a heart attack too, no kidding. It was all – my two sisters were here, waiting until about half-past four. They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call. My younger sister had brought an orange for Marie, and I had never seen an orange like it. It was a big orange, like that. She said, “Mary, look, when they call you, when you pick Marie up, let us know, and we’ll come over.” I said, “All right.” So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened. I called my brother-in-law. He was an undertaker. My sister’s husband – he’s passed away now too. God rest his soul. Maybe you know him... So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.” They had cleaned the pavement, and done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.” But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said. Well, my sisters and my mother, you know, they were all alive. It was a shock to everybody. That was a shock that – The neighborhood – Annie at the store always says, “Mrs. Costa,” every time I go in there, she reminds me, “I just picture Marie standing at that step, looking over here.” She used to stand at that step. She was a real quiet girl, pleasant, didn’t talk much, but she was so good, I can’t even tell you. That’s all. So that’s what happened.",

I told them not to move her from her bed because she was under ether. I told them that Marie was under ether and not to move her. They tried to move her anyway, and when they did, she collapsed. She probably got a blood clot from it because they were talking about what could've caused it. I still remember that day, I was at home and they called me to say that Marie was being discharged from the hospital. I had all the clothes laid out on the table. My husband was at work. I went there and I was praying for this woman who had a gall bladder operation. I was praying to God to not take away this mother from her daughters. I saw a nurse running and she came and asked me something. I asked her if she was running for my daughter, and she said yes, come in. I went in and saw my daughter sweating. The beads of sweat were huge. I started screaming \"You killed her, You killed my daughter !\", A lady doctor Ms. Montique who was an assistant to the doctor who performed the surgery came to speak to me. I screamed very loudly, they wanted to inject me with something. I told them \"You killed my daughter and now you want to kill me\". The receptionist kept calling my home to tell us to come and pick up Marie since she was discharged. My daughter told them that I had already left for the hospital. They all came quickly because they were worried about me. They took me back home. I started screaming when we reached home, I was still in the car. People were coming out of their homes to check what was going on. I kept screaming \"They killed her!\". My husband was sitting on the porch, and he asked me what was going on. I told him \"Marie is dead, they killed her\". I showed them pictures of my daughter, she was only eighteen. When her sister and my husband found out, they collapsed. I told my youngest son to go and tell my sisters Auntie Jenny and Auntie Millie what had happened. When he went to tell them what had happened, they thought he was coming to tell them that Marie had come back home but when they found out, they were shocked. My sister brought an orange earlier, a big orange, nothing like i had ever seen before. The local store owner praised Marie a lot, she said that Marie would always come to the store and stand there, pointing at the steps. \"She would always stand there and look over\", She was a quiet girl, not much to talk. She was a good girl, Marie. - So that's what happened.",

Marie was in hospital, having an operation to treat appendicitis, when a nurse tried to move her out of a bed into a chair - however, she was heavily sedated on Ether, and passed out whilst they were attempting to move her, forcing them to put her back into bed. The narrator believes this may have been the cause of the blood clot that resulted in her death. The narrator recounts the day in which she way supposed to pick up Marie from the hospital. She gathered several of her clothes, including a coat, and speaks about how they lacked a telephone, so the local store had agreed to call ahead and let the rest of the family know when Marie had been discharged. She arrived at the hospital and sat in a chair, and prayed for an elderly woman who was also undergoing an operation. Noticing several nurses grabbing cold towels, she inquired as to where her daughter was, and was then asked whether her daughter had a history of fainting. Worry began to set in - \"what have you done to my daughter?\", she asked, before being told to come with the nurse. The mother states that the beads of sweat appearing on her daughter's face were very large, and seeing this made the narrator lose herself with anguish, shouting at the nurses and the doctors that they had 'killed her daughter', and shortly after, as she turned her back, Marie died. The narrator had torn her own hair out and was still shouting, and was moved to a waiting area. She had refused 'a shot' from a doctor, believing they were going to kill her too.

They received a call through a local store that she was ready to be discharged - do they not have a phone? They got everything ready for Marie.

Costa quickly learned that they were running to treat a medical emergency for Marie, who had developed a clot in her leg.\n\nShe was taken to Marie's room. Marie was visibly unwell, sweating heavily and with an unnaturally stiff leg (described as 'like a pole' so probably stiff and swollen and possibly dying from the clot). Costa started to panic and become belligerent while the doctors rushed around trying to mitigate the situation. During that mess, Marie succumbed to the blood clot. Costa became understandably enraged and started shouting about how the hospital had killed her daughter (and complained that they wanted to kill her as well when offerings some sort of calming injection).\nAfter some more time the husband and other daughter arrived at the hospital, as they'd become concerned about the lack of updates. They learned at that point that Marie had died. However, Costa's story has an inconsistency from how I recall it here because she then goes on to say that her husband was waiting on the porch and asked what was wrong when she arrived and only sat in the car screaming.\n\nThey sent one of their other children or grandchildren to notify other relatives. He seems to have been a child and was crying by the time he arrived, leading them to ask what was wrong before he broke the news.\nCosta then rambles a bit more about unnecessary details but I don't remember them because they weren't key to the story.",

Mrs. Costa was filled with emotions and crying and wailing and then the doctor who carried out the operation came in and immediately, Mrs. Costa asked her what she did to her daughter but the doctor replied by saying she doesn't know what happened. Afterwards, the nurse advised her to talk to her daughter but Mrs. Costa was confused and she was in agony. Mrs. Costa husband was now home and expecting his wife to return with his daughter, he was calling the store to enquire what must have happened thinking that Marie was already discharged. So Rita went to the hospital herself and she was surprised at what she saw. Her mother broke the news that her sister, Marie has died and on hearing it, Rita could not control herself. She fell on the hard floor in shock and in grief and she had a problem that developed due to this fall. When Marie's body wanted to be moved, Mrs. Costa didn't allow it because she was in grief. When the news got to her husband and her son, they both got a heart attack and Mrs. Costa sent his junior son to go tell his uncle of what has happened.",

It is 10 days after her operation when Marie dies. I go to the hospital to collect her when she is meant to be discharged, I have my coat on my arm.

She ordered for coffee to be made as they prepare to go pick Marie. Marie saw her with the girls and shouted. She was welcomed by the nurse and she was asked whether her daughter had a fainting spell. She yelled upon seeing her daughter saying they killed her and she was ready to go home. The hospital kept calling and the people in the office had no information what happened. they thought mother got angry because of Marie. the nurses kept coming and they all knew her and told her to keep away. Rita came, told Marie was dead and she fainted. Marie's friend said that Marie was saying goodbye. she threatened to kill whoever tried to touch her daughter. she was in a mess. relatives and friends visited with oranges. she got home and called everybody telling them what happened. They kept on saying how Marie was good.",
    "98": "My daughter died. Twenty-eight years ago it'll be this Wednesday, yeah. She was in hospital, getting operated on for appendicitis. My eldest daughter Victoria went in to see her, and, at that time I didn't have a phone. But the girl at the store had a phone and the hospital called her to let me know to come pick Marie up, she had been discharged. Twenty-eight, no, thirtieth this month it'll be, yeah. She said to me, \"Mrs. Costa\", she said, \"The hospital called for you to pick up Marie.\" So I got ready to go, I told my daughter Rita to keep cooking, and I said, \"Put a pot of coffee on, Daddy will be home soon.\" He was working that day. I always put out coffee for Marie, the first coffee of the day was hers. But when my eldest daughter Victoria got there, she got to the bed Marie was at, and right next to it was a chair. She said to the nurse, \"What's this chair doing here?\" The nurse said \"We need to get her out of bed.\" but she was still under ether. Back then they used a lot of ether. So she said to the nurse, \"She can't get out of bed, she's still under ether. She's still sick.\" Then the nurse said, \"Well that's doctor's orders,\" so she goes to get Marie up, and she took a few steps then she collapsed on the floor. She was never - they asked, \"Does she have any fainting spells?\" and she was healthy. So they called the girl at the store, and she tells me to go to the hospital, and I go, with Marie's coat on my arm, and her undercoat, and her coat on my arm. I got there and the nurse's aide, she was a little thing, she said something to me. The nurse tells me to \"Just sit right here, sit down for a little while.\" and I got chills. Then I see the nurse's aide go into a closet and get a blanket out, then she turns to the nurse and says, \"she's got cold sweat.\" Then they started running, and I saw it, and I'm not exaggerating, there were huge beads of sweat, just running, just pouring down her face. I got closer to her and I started yelling at the nurses, \"What did you do to her? You killed her. You killed her!\" See, the nurses knew me, I had three operations there in no time, less than a year. They just kept coming, and I was yelling, \"You killed her! You killed her!\" The doctor rushes in, and - she was a lady doctor, Dr Schwartes. The doctor, a lady doctor, tried to give me a shot. And I said to them, \"Get away from me! You killed my daughter, and now you're trying to kill me?\" I started screaming, I was hysterical, banging my head against the wall and everything, I had hair pulled out, I was a mess. My husband had got home, gone upstairs to shave and shower, then sat on the steps waiting for Marie to come home. The hospital called the girl at the store again, and said, \"Where's the mother? Tell the mother to come to the hospital.\" The girl said, \"That's strange, the mother already went to the hospital, she should be there.\" Then they went up from the office. Then just as I turned my back, my daughter had passed away. I was screaming, crying, just a mess, and the lady doctor - they were all trying to get me to calm down. But she was only eighteen. I went home and told everybody what happened. My brother-in-law, he's an undertaker. I called my sisters. I sent my youngest son, James, to tell his Aunties what happened. They thought Marie would be coming home that day. They were cleaning the pavement, and doing the cement work, and cleaning the pavement. As soon as they saw little Jamie come up, they could see his eyes were all red, and they said to him, \"Jamie, honey, what's happened? Why are you crying?\" He said to them, \"Aunt Millie, Aunt, Marie's died. She died at hospital.\" When my husband came down from the steps, I told him, and no kidding, he had a heart attack, yeah. A heart attack. Then, my oldest son Michael came home, and I told him, and he had a heart attack too. Both of them, yeah. He collapsed on the floor. Everybody was coming out, they could hear the screams. I was hysterical, my hair was all pulled out, see. It'll be thirty years this month. Yeah, thirty years. She was only eighteen. \n",

    "100": "A very sad story of a 28-year-old girl who died a few days after an appendix operation",
    "101": "a mother was recalling events of how her 18 year old daughter marie died due to i believe they said a blood clot, she had been transferred from a bed to a chair which could have caused it (?). I believe I read something about her husband and son having a heart attack as well??? which was confusing because then the son told her sisters that were waiting back at home that marie had passed. the dad/husband was also at home excitingly waiting for marie. the mom had told the dad to prep coffee for marie for when shes back and they had also prepped something else that I cannot recall. If I recall correctly the surgery happened due to appendicitis. the mom was also screaming in the hospital at the doctors and nurses that they had killed her daughter. they used lots of ether. they did not have a phone so they were informed by a grocery store phone (?).

  "segmentation": "1. My daughter died.\n2. It’ll be twenty-eight years this month.\n3. The thirtieth of this month, yeah.\n4. She died at Methodist Hospital.\n5. She had an operation for appendicitis.\n6. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late.\n7. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was.\n8. She was still under ether.\n9. Back then, they used a lot of ether.\n10. There was a chair there.\n11. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know.\n12. So, Victoria saw the chair,\n13. and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?”\n14. The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.”\n15. She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.”\n16. “She’s too sick.”\n17. But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.”\n18. So, they went to get her out of bed,\n19. and she passed out,\n20. and they had to put her back in bed.\n21. See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what,\n22. but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed.\n23. So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days,\n24. I was waiting for the call from the hospital.\n25. I didn’t have a phone then.\n26. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night.\n27. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital.\n28. Go Pick Marie up.\n29. She’s discharged.”\n30. I had all the clothes laid out on the table.\n31. And Rita was – I was cooking,\n32. I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.”\n33. Daddy will be home soon.”\n34. He was working down in the yard.\n35. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee.\n36. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her.\n37. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers.\n38. Since she’s gone, I never forget that.\n39. So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on,\n40. and send for some cake from the bakery.”\n41. I’m going to get Marie; they called me.”\n42. “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.”\n43. And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm.\n44. She was operated on in March –\n45. No, April! So that was the thirtieth.\n46. She was operated – ten days before, so that would be the twentieth.\n47. The twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly.\n48. Oh, and I had everything in a bag,\n49. and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm.\n50. She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street.\n51. She said, “My mother’s just coming.”\n52. She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is.\n53. They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board.\n54. And to make sure I brought her girdle to put on.\n55. I said, “All right, I’ll be right over.”\n56. And I went.\n57. But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.”\n58. So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder.\n59. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children.\n60. They had said she was in very bad shape.\n61. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.”\n62. I was praying for her, you know.\n63. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets.\n64. I started getting the chills,\n65. and I was thinking about it,\n66. when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.”\n67. The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?”\n68. “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!”\n69. “Yes,” she said, “come on in.”\n70. So, I went into the room.\n71. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on.\n72. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big.\n73. It came – just poured from her –\n74. I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter?\n75. You killed her! You killed her!”\n76. That’s what I kept yelling.\n77. And the doctor rushed in,\n78. see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know.\n79. She was a lady doctor.\n80. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique.\n81. She was a lady doctor.\n82. So, she came in and she said –\n83. I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?”\n84. She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.”\n85. She took me away from the bed.\n86. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.”\n87. I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?”\n88. And I was screaming.\n89. My hair was all pulled out.\n90. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old.\n91. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture.\n92. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.\n93. She was getting ready to go home.\n94. I had the clothes and everything ready.\n95. My husband was waiting for her.\n96. He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting.\n97. “When is the mother coming?”\n98. The hospital kept calling.\n99. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet.\n100. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us.\n101. They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie?\n102. She’s discharged.”\n103. And Rita said “That’s strange, the mother went to the hospital. She should be there.”\n104. So they came back to the hospital to look for us.\n105. Rita said, “Gee, that’s strange,”\n106. she said, “Mother must’ve gotten really worked up about Marie.”\n107. You know, I’ve always had a bad heart.\n108. “Mother must’ve gotten so upset about Marie, she probably made herself sick,” Rita thought.\n109. So she came over with my son-in-law, in the car.\n110. And I was in the main hallway, at the office.\n111. I was all pulled apart.\n112. One doctor wanted to give me a shot.\n113. I said, “Get out of here,\n114. I’ll kick you,” I said.\n115. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?”\n116. Another nurse came over.\n117. See, they all knew me.\n118. I had three operations in no time, not even a year.\n119. And I knew all the nurses.\n120. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –”\n121. “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.”\n122. I was so hysterical.\n123. I was banging my head against the wall and everything.\n124. They had to grab me.\n125. Then they brought me to the office, see.\n126. When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?”\n127. I said, “We lost Marie.\n128. Marie died.”\n129. Well, that’s this one. This is a picture of Rita.\n130. She went down like lightning.\n131. Dropped to the floor, and that’s a marble floor.\n132. She went down like lightning.\n133. And the back of her leg, it felt just like a pole.\n134. Hard like a pole, the back of her leg.\n135. And that girl is suffering.\n136. Thirty – no, twenty-eight years since her sister died?\n137. When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it.\n138. She suffers – seven, eight, nine weeks at a time.\n139. She can’t walk, she goes through such pain since then.\n140. And how did they figure how Marie died?\n141. The girl who was walking with Marie,\n142. told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene.\n143. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.”\n144. And then Marie collapsed.\n145. Later, they said it was a blood clot.\n146. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter.\n147. I’ll burn this hospital down!\n148. I don’t care who’s in it.”\n149. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter.\n150. You want to find out what she died from.”\n151. But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.”\n152. I wouldn’t let them touch her.\n153. So when I got home – they took me home.\n154. I was screaming in the car.\n155. I couldn’t get out, you know, I couldn’t –\n156. I was screaming!\n157. Everybody came out, coming out of their doors because they could hear the screams.\n158. My husband was sitting on the step.\n159. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?”\n160. Well, my hair was all pulled, and my face – I was a mess.\n161. I didn’t know what I had done to myself.\n162. I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock.\n163. My husband had a heart attack.\n164. Yes, he had a heart attack.\n165. Then my son, Michael, yeah. That night.\n166. Right there, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed.\n167. He had a heart attack too, no kidding.\n168. It was all – my two sisters were here, waiting until about half-past four.\n169. They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call.\n170. My younger sister had brought an orange for Marie, and I had never seen an orange like it. It was a big orange, like that.\n171. She said, “Mary, look, when they call you, when you pick Marie up, let us know, and we’ll come over.”\n172. I said, “All right.”\n173. So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened.\n174. I called my brother-in-law.\n175. He was an undertaker.\n176. My sister’s husband – he’s passed away now too. God rest his soul.\n177. Maybe you know him...\n178. So they were waiting for my call, you know,\n179. but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then.\n180. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.”\n181. They had cleaned the pavement,\n182. and done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement.\n183. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said,\n184. “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.”\n185. But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red.\n186. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey?\n187. Why are you crying?”\n188. “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said.\n189. Well, my sisters and my mother, you know, they were all alive.\n190. It was a shock to everybody. That was a shock that –\n191. The neighborhood – Annie at the store always says, “Mrs. Costa,” every time I go in there, she reminds me, “I just picture Marie standing at that step, looking over here.” She used to stand at that step.\n192. She was a real quiet girl, pleasant, didn’t talk much,\n193. but she was so good, I can’t even tell you.\n194. That’s all. So that’s what happened.",

Costa became understandably enraged and started shouting about how the hospital had killed her daughter\n31. and complained that they wanted to kill her as well when offerings some sort of calming injection.\n32. After some more time the husband and other daughter arrived at the hospital,\n33. as they'd become concerned about the lack of updates.\n34. They learned at that point that Marie had died.\n35.

    "98": "1. My daughter died.\n2. Twenty-eight years ago it'll be this Wednesday, yeah.\n3. She was in hospital, getting operated on for appendicitis.\n4. My eldest daughter Victoria went in to see her,\n5. and, at that time I didn't have a phone.\n6. But the girl at the store had a phone\n7. and the hospital called her to let me know to come pick Marie up,\n8. she had been discharged.\n9. Twenty-eight, no, thirtieth this month it'll be, yeah.\n10. She said to me, \"Mrs. Costa\", she said,\n11. \"The hospital called for you to pick up Marie.\"\n12. So I got ready to go,\n13. I told my daughter Rita to keep cooking,\n14. and I said, \"Put a pot of coffee on, Daddy will be home soon.\"\n15. He was working that day.\n16. I always put out coffee for Marie,\n17. the first coffee of the day was hers.\n18. But when my eldest daughter Victoria got there,\n19. she got to the bed Marie was at,\n20. and right next to it was a chair.\n21. She said to the nurse, \"What's this chair doing here?\"\n22. The nurse said \"We need to get her out of bed.\"\n23. but she was still under ether.\n24. Back then they used a lot of ether.\n25. So she said to the nurse, \"She can't get out of bed, she's still under ether.\n26. She's still sick.\"\n27. Then the nurse said, \"Well that's doctor's orders,\"\n28. so she goes to get Marie up,\n29. and she took a few steps then she collapsed on the floor.\n30. She was never - they asked, \"Does she have any fainting spells?\"\n31. and she was healthy.\n32. So they called the girl at the store,\n33. and she tells me to go to the hospital,\n34. and I go, with Marie's coat on my arm,\n35. and her undercoat,\n36. and her coat on my arm.\n37. I got there and the nurse's aide, she was a little thing,\n38. she said something to me.\n39. The nurse tells me to \"Just sit right here, sit down for a little while.\"\n40. and I got chills.\n41. Then I see the nurse's aide go into a closet and get a blanket out,\n42. then she turns to the nurse and says, \"she's got cold sweat.\"\n43. Then they started running,\n44. and I saw it, and I'm not exaggerating,\n45. there were huge beads of sweat, just running, just pouring down her face.\n46. I got closer to her\n47. and I started yelling at the nurses, \"What did you do to her? You killed her. You killed her!\"\n48. See, the nurses knew me, I had three operations there in no time, less than a year.\n49. They just kept coming,\n50. and I was yelling, \"You killed her! You killed her!\"\n51. The doctor rushes in,\n52. and - she was a lady doctor, Dr Schwartes.\n53. The doctor, a lady doctor, tried to give me a shot.\n54. And I said to them, \"Get away from me! You killed my daughter, and now you're trying to kill me?\"\n55. I started screaming, I was hysterical,\n56. banging my head against the wall and everything,\n57. I had hair pulled out,\n58. I was a mess.\n59. My husband had got home,\n60. gone upstairs to shave and shower,\n61. then sat on the steps waiting for Marie to come home.\n62. The hospital called the girl at the store again,\n63. and said, \"Where's the mother? Tell the mother to come to the hospital.\"\n64. The girl said, \"That's strange, the mother already went to the hospital, she should be there.\"\n65. Then they went up from the office.\n66. Then just as I turned my back,\n67. my daughter had passed away.\n68. I was screaming, crying, just a mess,\n69. and the lady doctor - they were all trying to get me to calm down.\n70. But she was only eighteen.\n71. I went home and told everybody what happened.\n72. My brother-in-law, he's an undertaker.\n73. I called my sisters.\n74. I sent my youngest son, James, to tell his Aunties what happened.\n75. They thought Marie would be coming home that day.\n76. They were cleaning the pavement, and doing the cement work, and cleaning the pavement.\n77. As soon as they saw little Jamie come up,\n78. they could see his eyes were all red,\n79. and they said to him, \"Jamie, honey, what's happened? Why are you crying?\"\n80. He said to them, \"Aunt Millie, Aunt, Marie's died. She died at hospital.\"\n81. When my husband came down from the steps,\n82. I told him,\n83. and no kidding, he had a heart attack, yeah.\n84. A heart attack.\n85. Then, my oldest son Michael came home,\n86. and I told him,\n87. and he had a heart attack too.\n88. Both of them, yeah.\n89. He collapsed on the floor.\n90. Everybody was coming out, they could hear the screams.\n91. I was hysterical, my hair was all pulled out, see.\n92. It'll be thirty years this month.\n93. Yeah, thirty years.\n94. She was only eighteen.",
    "99": "1. The daughter died,\n2. as did Aunt Jennie,\n3. and Auntie Millie,\n4. Mrs. Costa brought some cakes,\n5. from the bakery,\n6. at quarter to five,\n7. at night.\n8. She did,\n9. of a blood clot,\n10. Dr. Swartz killed her,\n11. The mother told her,\n12. not to touch her daughter.\n13. An orange was brought.\n14. The brother-in-law was called,\n15. it was cold outside.\n16. When Marie was discharged,\n17. someone was to go to the hospital,\n18. and pick her up,\n19. all her clothes were laid out,\n20. ready.\n21. Rita was told to finish cooking,\n22. as daddy would be home soon,\n23. he was working in the yard.\n24. Coffee was requested,\n25. as she wanted some,\n26. first thing in the morning was best,\n27. I never forget that she liked it.",
    "100": "1. A very sad story of a 28-year-old girl\n2. who died\n3. a few days after an appendix operation",
    "101": "1. A mother was recalling events\n2. of how her 18-year-old daughter Marie died\n3. due to (I believe they said) a blood clot.\n4. She had been transferred\n5. from a bed to a chair\n6. which could have caused it (?).\n7. I believe I read something\n8. about her husband and son\n9. having a heart attack as well (?).\n10. Which was confusing\n11. because then the son told her sisters\n12. that were waiting back at home\n13. that Marie had passed.\n14. The dad/husband was also at home\n15. excitingly waiting for Marie.\n16. The mom had told the dad\n17. to prep coffee for Marie\n18. for when she's back\n19. and they had also prepped something else\n20. that I cannot recall.\n21. If I recall correctly\n22. the surgery happened\n23. due to appendicitis.\n24. The mom was also screaming in the hospital\n25. at the doctors and nurses\n26. that they had killed her daughter.\n27. They used lots of ether.\n28. They did not have a phone\n29. so they were informed\n30. by a grocery store phone (?)."
